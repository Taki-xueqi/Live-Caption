# Live Video and Image Translator

## Project Description

This project aims to provide live translation of text from videos (webcam, screen capture, video files) and images. The system is designed to detect text in the input source, translate it into a desired language, and then output the translation visually (as an overlay or in a separate window) and audibly (with appropriate emotional tone).

**Note:** This repository currently contains the initial project structure and placeholder (stub) code. The core functionalities (OCR, translation, TTS, video processing) are not yet implemented.

## Architecture Overview

The project is built around the following core components:

*   **Input Handler (`src/input_handler.py`):** Manages input from various sources like webcams, screen captures, or image/video files.
*   **Text Extractor (`src/text_extractor.py`):** Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and extract text from the input frames/images.
*   **Translation Engine (`src/translation_engine.py`):** Translates the extracted text into the user-specified target language using translation APIs or local models.
*   **Speech Synthesizer (`src/speech_synthesizer.py`):** Converts the translated text into speech, aiming to incorporate emotional tone based on the context.
*   **Output Displayer (`src/output_displayer.py`):** Presents the translated text visually, either as an overlay on the original source or in a dedicated display area.
*   **Main Application (`src/main.py`):** Orchestrates the interaction between all components and manages the overall application flow and configuration.

## Current Status

*   Project directory structure created.
*   Core component modules have been stubbed out with placeholder classes and methods.
*   Basic `main.py` can run the conceptual pipeline using these stubs.

## Setup and Running (Conceptual)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd live_video_translator
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (once `requirements.txt` is added):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Currently, no `requirements.txt` is provided as core dependencies are not yet integrated).*

4.  **Run the application (conceptual example):**
    The main entry point is `src/main.py`. You can run it as a module:
    ```bash
    python -m live_video_translator.src.main
    ```
    This will execute the stubbed pipeline, printing messages to the console.

## Future Development (High-Level)

*   Implement actual video/image capture in `InputHandler`.
*   Integrate an OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract, EasyOCR) into `TextExtractor`.
*   Connect to a translation service (e.g., Google Translate API) in `TranslationEngine`.
*   Implement speech synthesis using a TTS library/service in `SpeechSynthesizer`, with research into emotional tone generation.
*   Develop text overlay or display mechanisms in `OutputDisplayer`.
*   Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   Create unit and integration tests.
*   Develop a user interface for configuration and interaction.
*   Package the application for easier distribution.
